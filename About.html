            <h2>History of Ozamiz City</h2>
            <p>Ozamiz City, the capital of Misamis Occidental, has a rich history that dates back to the Spanish colonial period. Originally known as "Misamis," it was established as a municipality during the Spanish era in 1623. It became a city in 1948 through Republic Act No. 323, marking a significant milestone in its development.</p>
            <p>During the Second World War, the city faced numerous challenges and endured hardships, but its residents showed resilience. Today, Ozamiz City thrives as a center of commerce and culture in the region.The city of Ozamiz grew out of an old Spanish town called Misamis—a name believed to have been derived from the Subanen word kuyamis, a variety of coconut. Other unverified historical sources, however, suggest that the name Misamis came from the Spanish word Misa (Catholic Mass).

                The old Spanish town grew in size due to the nearby Spanish garrison stationed at the stone fort named Fuerte de la Concepcion y del Triunfo. The fort was constructed some time in 1756 in order to attempt to combat the pirate activities originating in the nearby Lanao area. In 1850, the town of Misamis became the capital of the District of Misamis.
                
                During the American occupation, the territory was reduced when Governor-General Francis Burton Harrison issued Executive Order No. 61, series of 1920; the barrios, which was once part of the former municipality of Loculan, were separated and organized into new municipalities of Clarin and Tudela.
                
                In October 1942, Wendell Fertig established the command headquarters of the growing guerrilla resistance to the Japanese occupation of Mindanao in the Spanish fort in the city. His headquarters was abandoned June 26, 1943, due to a large Japanese attack.[9] Until the end of the war, the Japanese occupied this fort. During the Japanese occupation of Misamis in World War II, the "Cotta" was garrisoned by a contingent of Japanese who dug foxholes near or under the walls. This undermining of walls later led to the destruction of the southwest bastion in the earthquake of 1955.
                
                After the war, Misamis became a chartered city by virtue of Republic Act 321 on July 16, 1948. This also renamed Misamis to Ozamiz after a hero José Ozámiz who hailed from the province of Misamis Occidental and who at one time also served as its governor and congressional representative of the Lone District of Misamis Occidental, a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention that resulted in the creation of the 1935 Constitution for the Philippine Commonwealth Government. In 1941, José Ozámiz was elected to the Philippine Senate.
